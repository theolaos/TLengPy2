Updates on what is added-removed problems found-solved

21-6-2023 Wednsday:
Found the reason why the screen waited to load the entities and sunch, 
    we were importing the modules after we had initialised the screen, meaning the screen 
    had opened and after the modules were loaded only then it started to render the entities thus the 
    lag between the window appearing and then the entities appearing

Updated documantation and added/changed some features, such as the:
    - Group class (which i created and then deleted, it was going to work as the group class in sprites but figured i will use the pygame.sprite.Sprite)
    - Added self.image in Area wich is pygame.Surface([width, height])
    - Updating the documantation on Label class (as it's going to be used in the button classes)
    - Updating the documantation in Entity on __init__()
    - Updating the documantation in Area on __init__()
    - Updating the documantation in pygame.sprite.Sprites() Class Abstractgroup function draw()

Learned about the class python and pygame functions:
    -hasattr (does it have the attribute "y" return "x")
    -getattr (what is the attribute "y" return "x" , and if not defaults="z")
    -blits [(source: Surface, dest: Coordinate | RectValue, area: RectValue | None = None, special_flags: int = 0), ...] -> Rect
    -Documantation of return for functions: -> Tuple[str, List[float], int]

__all__ doesn't work well in the Tleng2.py file
constants aren't really constants
