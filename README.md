# TLengPy2

Tleng engine, is a game engine written in python and the pygame-ce module. For the Engine to work, you need to have installed pygame-ce!

The reason I started this project is to see what it takes to create a 2d game engine, and for me to get an even better introduction to computer 2d graphics.

The code is here to either inspire someone else to start a similar project, or to give some insight on a few things.

On every single update there will always be an example, in the `examples` folder.

## For the documentation check the wiki!

## Games that use this engine/framework:

- [RainCoin](https://github.com/TheooKing/RainCoin) (Framework ver: 2.0-dev)

## Requirements
- python 3.11+
- Pygame Community Edition 2.2+

## Additional Bundled Software for TLengPy2 (still in development)

This software will have a GUI for the user

- Level Creator
- Assistant for inputing assets to your game (Import Wizard)
- Scene Creator
- Sprite + Animation Creator (Pixel Art)

## The meaning behind the symbolising of the updates are 2.x.y-z:

2 = the engine is 2d (and because it's better than the previous try)

x = The general full release version 

y = The bug fix version for the general release

z = is either Beta/Alpha/dev of the general release or the bug fix version

> ## :warning: WARNING 
>
> The game engine is still in the early
> stages, so please note that for every new
> push it is no guranteed that the code will > reliably work with previous or current
> projects. Check the releases before 
> attempting to get the newest from source.
