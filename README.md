TLengPy2 (pronounced: tlenk-pie-two) is a game engine written in python with the pygame-ce and NumPy modules.

The reason I started this project is to see what it takes to create a 2d game engine, and for me to get an even better introduction to computer 2d graphics.

The code is here to either inspire someone else to start a similar project, or to give some insight on a few things.

On every single general release update there always will be an example game, in the `examples` folder.
