# Tleng2

(I am new to github so the helping (pulling requests, branches and such) stuff is something i don't quite get yet)

Tleng engine, is an engine written in python and based on the pygame library.

The reason i started this project to see what it takes to create a 2d engine, and for me to get an even better introduction to computer 2d graphics.

The code displayed here, is open to be used by anyone. If someone wants to add something, could either tell me or do it himself, by pulling a request.

The code is here to either inspire someone else to start a similar project, or to give some insight on a few things.

Short code documantation:

# Classes:
