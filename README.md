# TLengPy2

Tleng engine, is a game engine written in python and based on the pygame library. For the Engine to work, you need to have installed pygame!

The reason I started this project is to see what it takes to create a 2d game engine, and for me to get an even better introduction to computer 2d graphics.

The code is here to either inspire someone else to start a similar project, or to give some insight on a few things.

On every single update there will always be an example, in the `examples` folder.

## For the documentation check the wiki!

## Games that use this engine/framework:

- [RainCoin](https://github.com/TheooKing/RainCoin) (Framework ver: 2.0-dev)

## Requirements
- python 3.11+
- Pygame 2.3+ or Pygame Community Edition 2.2+

## Additional Bundled Software for TLengPy2 (still in development)

This software will have a GUI for the user

- Level Creator
- Assistant for inputing assets to your game (Import Wizard)
- Scene Creator
- Sprite + Animation Creator (Pixel Art)

## The meaning behind the symbolising of the updates are 2.x.y-z:

2 = the engine is 2d (and because it's better than the previous try)

x = The general full release version 

y = The bug fix version for the general release

z = is either Beta/Alpha/dev of the general release or the bug fix version

## WARNING 

The game engine is still in the early stages, so please note that for every new push it is no guranteed that the code will reliably work. Check the realeases before attampting to get the newest from cloning the project.
