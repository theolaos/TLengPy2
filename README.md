# Tleng2

(I am new to github so the helping (pulling requests, branches and such) stuff is something i don't quite get yet)

Tleng engine, is an engine written in python and based on the pygame library.

The reason i started this project to see what it takes to create a 2d engine, and for me to get an even better introduction to computer 2d graphics.

The code displayed here, is open to be used by anyone. If someone wants to add something, could either tell me or do it himself, by pulling a request.

The code is here to either inspire someone else to start a similar project, or to give some insight on a few things.

## The planned full releases are:

- 2.0 Documentation ( <- we are here, beta)

- 2.1 Hitbox and Coordination (simplify code, update/implement TODOs, examples)

- 2.2 sound and camera-scene handlers 

- 2.3 Available package at PyPi.org + collisions update, particles, AI, missions async update (publication of git page)

- 2.4 Physics implementation module

- 2.5 Full Raycasting support

### The meaning behind the symbolising of the updates are 2.x.y-z:

2 = the engine is 2d (and because it's better than the previous try)

x = The general full release version 

y = The bug fix version for the general release

z = is either Beta/Alpha of the general release
